This is a simple digital clock website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current system time in hours, minutes, and seconds, with the seconds updating automatically every second.
HTML is used to create the structure, CSS is used to design a clean and modern layout, and JavaScript is used to fetch and update the real-time clock using the Date object and setInterval() function.
